# Protein-Consumption-Analysis
Performing clustering analysis on European protein consumption data to uncover patterns across regions and protein sources. Visualizations reveal insights into consumption patterns in European countries. Findings enhance understanding of European protein consumption, highlighting similarities and differences among regions and sources.

Introduction: This project in R aims to perform clustering analysis on protein consumption data for different European countries. The visualization and clustering analysis provide valuable insights into European protein consumption patterns across geographic regions and protein sources. By clustering the data based on similarities, distinct clusters are represented by different colors. One plot focuses on red and white meat consumption, revealing similarities in consumption patterns among European countries. The project includes importing datasets, scaling the variables, and applying the k-means clustering algorithm. The resulting clusters are visualized through scatter plots of various protein variables, such as red meat vs. white meat, milk vs. eggs, and milk vs. cereals. The analysis enhances our understanding of European protein consumption by highlighting similarities and differences among regions and protein sources.
